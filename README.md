# pagination folks pagination

##### life also has a book with many pages. Do good and hence a nice pagination in life

- When it comes to pagination. We have two ways to work on it.

1. On the Front End: Getting all the data via API and Paginate it
2. Second way is Pagination on the Server. In that case, we are requesting different pages from the server. It is already paginated on the server and we only have to pass the query-string (may be a page number) to get the data.

** In this project, I'll do Pagination on the Front End **
